##  CAGE - Competing Agents in a Growing Environment

A constraint programming-based maze problem where multiple teams of identical agents race to navigate a dynamic maze. The maze adapts and evolves based on agent movements, blocking paths, and introducing new obstacles. 

Agents are limited by fog of war, meaning they can only see a portion of the maze unless they meet and share their vision. Teams must balance exploration, strategy, and cooperation to reach the goal first, while the self-modifying maze constantly learns from their actions to make traversal harder.
